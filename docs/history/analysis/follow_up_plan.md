# Follow-up Work Plan: Micro-Service Inference Engine

## Executive Summary
Based on the comprehensive analysis in `micro_service_analysis.md`, this plan addresses the key architectural decisions, performance optimizations, and production readiness requirements for the inference engine.

## Phase 1: Architecture Decision & Design

### 1.1 Architecture Decision - Micro-Service Design for Research
**Decision**: **Full Micro-Service Architecture** (NOT hybrid)

Based on the architecture decision document, this project has specific research-oriented requirements:
- **Zero-cost abstraction** for accurate profiling
- **Maximum decoupling** for algorithm designers
- **Easy debugging** with interface example data
- **Frontend developer experience** for all team members

### 1.2 Service Architecture Definition
**Core Services** (as defined in architecture_decision.md):

1. **Online Server/Offline Engine**
   - Reference: vLLM/SGLang for simple function transfer
   - RESTful API for function calls
   - Minimal overhead design

2. **Tokenizer Service**
   - HuggingFace tokenizer (fast tokenizer from transformers)
   - Standalone service with clear API
   - Interface example data for testing

3. **Scheduler Service**
   - Resource management (control flow/execution plan)
   - Profiled results storage
   - Endpoint definition for algorithm experiments

4. **Memory Manager Service**
   - Hierarchical memory plan support
   - GPU-only KV cache management (current scope)
   - Extensible for future hierarchical plans

5. **Computation Manager Service**
   - Execution model implementation
   - Simple transformers causal LLM
   - REST API for alternative kernels
   - Predefined execution plans

### 1.3 Zero-Cost Micro-Service Design
**Key Principles**:
- **Zero abstraction overhead** - services can be composed in-process
- **Maximum decoupling** - each service has independent interface
- **Research-friendly** - easy to swap implementations
- **Debuggable** - each service provides example data and interfaces

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use service interfaces that can be composed in-process (zero-cost)
- Provide REST APIs for external access/debugging
- Allow unit testing of individual services
- Support both local and distributed deployment modes

### 1.2 Define Service Boundaries
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Map current service interfaces to actual computational boundaries
- [ ] Identify which services should be in-process vs out-of-process
- [ ] Create clear API contracts between components

**Key Services to Define**:
- Model Service (core inference)
- Tokenizer Service (text processing)
- Scheduler Service (request batching)
- Memory Service (KV cache management)

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

### 2.1 Zero-Cost Profiling
