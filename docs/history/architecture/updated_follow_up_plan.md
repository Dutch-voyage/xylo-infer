# Updated Follow-up Work Plan: Research-Oriented Micro-Service Inference Engine

## Executive Summary
Based on the architecture decision document, this plan prioritizes **full micro-service architecture** designed specifically for research use cases, emphasizing zero-cost abstraction, maximum decoupling, and algorithm designer experience.

## Phase 1: Research-Oriented Architecture Design

### 1.1 Architecture Decision - Micro-Service for Research
**Decision**: **Full Micro-Service Architecture** (NOT hybrid)

**Core Requirements from Architecture Decision**:
- **Zero-cost abstraction** for accurate profiling
- **Maximum decoupling** for algorithm designers
- **Easy debugging** with interface example data
- **Frontend developer experience** for all team members
- **Research-oriented** - treat everyone as frontend developer

### 1.2 Service Architecture Definition
**Core Services** (as defined in architecture_decision.md):

1. **Online Server/Offline Engine**
   - Reference: vLLM/SGLang for simple function transfer
   - RESTful API for function calls
   - Minimal overhead design

2. **Tokenizer Service**
   - HuggingFace tokenizer (fast tokenizer from transformers)
   - Standalone service with clear API
   - Interface example data for testing

3. **Scheduler Service**
   - Resource management (control flow/execution plan)
   - Profiled results storage
   - Endpoint definition for algorithm experiments

4. **Memory Manager Service**
   - Hierarchical memory plan support
   - GPU-only KV cache management (current scope)
   - Extensible for future hierarchical plans

5. **Computation Manager Service**
   - Execution model implementation
   - Simple transformers causal LLM
   - REST API for alternative kernels
   - Predefined execution plans

### 1.3 Zero-Cost Micro-Service Design
**Key Principles**:
- **Zero abstraction overhead** - services can be composed in-process
- **Maximum decoupling** - each service has independent interface
- **Research-friendly** - easy to swap implementations
- **Debuggable** - each service provides example data and interfaces

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use service interfaces that can be composed in-process (zero-cost)
- Provide REST APIs for external access/debugging
- Allow unit testing of individual services
- Support both local and distributed deployment modes
